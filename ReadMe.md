This project is a mobile-friendly version of the classic 2048 puzzle game, where you combine numbered tiles to reach the glorious **2048** tile! And guess what? It even works on the web! 🌐

## How to Play 🕹️

- **Swipe** in any direction (left, right, up, or down) to slide the tiles.
- **Combine tiles** with the same value to create larger numbers (2, 4, 8, 16... and finally, 2048).
- You win when you reach **2048**!
- **Keep going** if you're a true champion and see how high you can score.
- Oh, and no pressure, but if you can't make a valid move, it's **Game Over**! 😅

## File Structure 📂

This project is split into multiple files for maintainability. You can find all the code under the `src` folder:

- **src/App.js**: Entry point of the project.
- **src/components/Game.js**: Handles game logic and state management.
- **src/components/Board.js**: Renders the board and tiles.
- **src/components/Tile.js**: Displays individual tiles on the board.
- **src/components/Modals.js**: Game Over and Victory modals (you'll see them often, hopefully the victory one 😉).
- **src/hooks/useSwipeHandler.js**: Custom hook for swipe gestures and keyboard handling.
- **src/utils/boardUtils.js**: All the logic to move tiles and validate moves.

## Credits 🤝
